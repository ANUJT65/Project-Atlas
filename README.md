## Problem Statement :

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/539e9c60-50b0-4ee3-b786-b54bcefda38a)

## Introduction

In today's **fast-paced** software development landscape, traditional methods for **requirement gathering**, **documentation**, and **test case generation** are labor-intensive, error-prone, and time-consuming. These challenges demand a transformative solution, where **precision** and **compliance** are critical.

**Project ATLAS** automates the entire lifecycle of **software development and documentation** using advanced **Generative AI**. 

Moreover, **Project ATLAS** streamlines the extraction of **requirements** from both **textual** and **graphical inputs**, generates structured **SRS**/**BRD** or any type of requirement documents, and seamlessly integrates with **JIRA** for automated backlog updates and efficient **workflow management**.

## Objectives

- **Automate Requirement Extraction**  
  AI-driven analysis of documents and graphics to generate structured requirements, significantly reducing manual effort.

- **Streamline Documentation**  
  Automatically generate standardized **SRS, SOW, BRD** documents, and **JIRA user stories** to accelerate the documentation process based on user input, speeding up the documentation process by **90 percent**.

- **Enhance Security**  
  Leverage **MFA**, and **RBAC**(Role-based Access Control) to ensure that all sensitive data remains secure and compliant.

- **Integrate with JIRA & Workplace Automation**  
  Seamlessly push updates to JIRA and automate workflow processes to ensure efficient **backlog management**.

- **Accelerate Testing**  
  AI-powered test case generation and code documentation reduce manual efforts by **70 percent**.
  
- **Enable Multi-User Collaboration**  
  Supports **scalable**, concurrent usage with role-based access control and versioned document management, where each team (sde/dev ops/analyst) can edit/version the document based on the client's requirement on
  dashboard.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6002f0fe-e42b-4072-b063-b385394303e1)

Project Atlas is superior by combining features of both **Requirements Management Software (RMS) and Agile Project Management & Documentation Tools**. Rather than competing directly, we provide an **end-to-end solution** for Requirement Engineering with:
- AI-Powered Requirement Gathering
- JIRA Integration
- Automated User Story Generation
- Traceability & Compliance
- Collaboration & Documentation

## Design Considerations:

1. **Why Azure Functions?**
   - We use Azure Functions for **serverless, event-driven automation** in our tool. This approach helps:
      - Handle diverse type of  inputs and for processing them.
      - Secure APIs with scalability and cost-efficiency
      - Integrate seamlessly with other Azure services

2. **Choice of LLMs/LVMs?(PLEASE DO SEE THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS IN ARCHITECTURE)**
   - Using **Gemini/Grok APIs** would risk exposing enterprise data to third-party companies.
   - Project Atlas deals with sensitive data, so we use **Ollama** and **Azure VMs** to privately host open-source LLMs/LVMs like **LLama (3B, 7B)** and **LLAVA 7B** parameter models to handle document inputs appropriately **OR**
   -  **Azure OpenAI** is also a choice where we have enterprise grade security and cost effectiveness with ease of integration with company infra.(Microsoft azure gurantees that the customer info wont be used for open ai to train its outputs on...so its a choice which would depend on company.)
   - AzureOpenAI Security Clause: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy?utm_source=chatgpt.com&tabs=azure-portal.


3. **Why Use RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)?**
   - **RAG systems** help us quickly find and use only the most relevant information from a large database.
   - By using vector search with **Cosmos DB** and limiting the amount of data given to the language model, RAG systems create more accurate and insightful outputs.
  

4. **Why Internal Context and AI Agent for External Context?**
   - Requirement gathering needs data from within the company (Business Team, DevOps Team, etc.) as well as from external markets, social trends, newer regulations, study groups, clients, and service providers.
   - Both sources need to be accounted for, and thus we maintain internal and external contexts, and an AI agent helps search for the information missing from the internal contexts with the tool of web search.

5. **Why and How Versioning with Blob Storage?**
   - Project management involves drafting documents multiple times before approval.
   - We use **Azure Blob Storage** for **automatic version control**.
   - Users from each team can track, manage, and restore versions, ensuring integrity, transparency, and accountability.

# Security Aspects:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82b0f594-c93b-46d3-bbf4-8e8c43a653fd)

Security and data protection are paramount for Project ATLAS, especially when handling sensitive enterprise requirements and documentation. Our comprehensive security approach includes:
1. **Local Open-Source LLMs Deployed on Azure VMs** (Terms and conditions applied, do see the architecture diagram)
   - Deploying Ollama Local LLMs on Azure VMs (GPU/CPU) ensures that  in-house data is not leaked and **ensures integrity**.
   - Such a setup makes an LLM fully customizable; however, scaling needs to be taken care of.
   - So current choice is of **Azure OpenAI** as Microsoft ensures security and  the cost of vms(for testing is very high) but in future if **Company** is concerned about security we would use the approach of privately deployed llms.
   - **Microsoft Azure OpenAI Data privacy clause**
   - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy?utm_source=chatgpt.com&tabs=azure-portal
     
2. **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**
   - Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for **secure logins**.
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to **restrict access** based on job functions.
   - **Conditional Access Policies** to enforce security.
   - **Least privilege principles** ensure users only access what they need.
  
3. **Industry Level Data Encryption Standards**
   - **AES-256** for data encryption at rest.
   - **TLS 1.2/1.3** for secure communication between components.
   - **RSA-2048** for key exchange mechanisms.
   - **SHA-256** for hashing and data integrity verification.
  
# Scalability

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89059016-8319-4d97-baf7-573bda53cafd)

1. **Azure Cloud** - Enterprise-grade cloud platform that seamlessly integrates with Company's existing tech infrastructure, **providing compliance controls** and **unified security policies** across all Project Atlas components.

2. **Azure Functions** - **Provides serverless compute resources** that automatically scale based on demand, allowing us to efficiently process document inputs, LLM requests, and user story generation without managing infrastructure.

3. **Blob Storage** - Highly scalable cloud storage solution that securely **manages document versioning** with automatic redundancy, allowing teams to track changes and restore previous versions of requirement documents.

4. **Containerized Services** - **Docker-based deployment approach** that packages application components with their dependencies, ensuring consistent operation across development, testing, and production environments.

5. **Azure VMs** - Customizable virtual machines with flexible compute options that host the web application and LLMs, **allowing for rapid vertical scaling** during peak usage periods without compromising data integrity.

6. **Azure Cosmos DB** - Globally distributed, multi-model database service that efficiently **stores and queries vector embeddings** with low latency, enabling fast semantic search capabilities for requirement extraction.

## Closing Remarks

Thank you very much for allowing us to show our idea. We have tried to show as much implementation and documentation as we can, and we hope you like our idea.



## Future work:
- We are working on a microsoft teams integration , which would directly send all the meeting documents, transcripts etc directly to Project Atlas dashboard, so that requirement documents can be formed directly from your meets.
- We are also working on fine tuning the large language models so that the document output is precise.
- Along with this we are also working towards github bot integration so that you can push your codes directly from project Atlas to github.
